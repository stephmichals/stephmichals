Wal-Mart infuriated enough employees and customers to make a drastic change in the national hourly pay. For former Tennessee employee, Nicholas Laszlo, the education and life of his children was his motivation to make a change. Effective February 10th, 2016, Wal-Mart announced a groundbreaking change in their minimum wage from the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour to $10 an hour for all associates and $13.38 an hour for the average full-time hourly wage.
